							<p>Here I created a real estate landing page that is designed to be fully responsive across all devices. Rather than having a multiple page website, I utilized a single-page scroll feature for a seamless user experience. Making the scroll feature vs a multiple page/tab website on both mobile and desktop is a quicker, more consistent way for users to access information. Please view the links below to see further details on the landing page design.</p>

Users are able to register as volunteers, search for events in their area, and sign up for events as volunteers. Users are also able to register as organizers that administer their nonprofit organization pages, create a calendar of events, and request volunteers.</p>

							<p>This app was created during my final group project at LEARN Academy, a rails full-stack development bootcamp in San Diego. The app was created from Rails version 5 and postgresql in the back end.</p>
							<p>I was involved in general theme styling and integrating the calendar of events both on the user & organization profile. I added a toggle feature so users can switch between a calendar and map of upcoming events. In the back end, I created the organization and user database relationship so users can have many organizations and organizations can have many users. Feature and integration testing was preformed through RSpec and Capybara. </p>

							<p>The purpose of this app is for park rangers to have a simple way to report wildlife sightings.

Sighting can be created with the input of a date, time, latitude and longitude.</p>

							<p>I utilized a scaffolding command to build a CRUD interface with  Ruby on Rails. This way, rangers are able to view, update, edit and destroy the animals and sightings they create.</p>

							<p>In the app, I added a jQuery calendar plug-in so users can have a calendar displaying all of a given month's animal sightings. I later included functionality with Ajax, where a user/ranger can go to an animal or sightings page and add additional information without any hard refreshing or redirects of the page.</p>

						<p>- create user stories (ex. Given that i’m on the landing page…/As a user……)</p>
						<p>- wireframing: basic structure/layout & notes (1/2 wireframes before prototype)</p>

							<p>Now wishing I would've started my web dev/designer blog a long time ago! I have a Wordpress music blog, but I wanted to try a new form of blogging for this one.<br><br>

							I'm currently launching a separate site specifically for my blog, but in the meantime I will start posting content here on my portfolio site. The blog is being created using Hugo, which is a static site generator and it's being hosted through github pages.<br><br>

							Hugo was a great option for my blog primarily because it's lightweight and fast. It doesn't need a database or to rely on php on the backend(Wordpress' major downfall).<br><br>

							I would highly recommend using Hugo for your clients websites, especially if there's no need for any sort of complex eCommerce solution.</br><br>

							In my work, I strive to combine both design and development processes and bridge them together,so the topics I will write about will vary.<br><br>

							My goal is to share as much knowledge as possible with my fellow designers and developers out there (although I am just starting out haha)! I also find a lot of interest in human computer interaction/ user experience as well as digital marketing so I will post articles and case studies along those topics as well.

							<p>Know when it's time to ask for help!</p>

						<div class="sr-only project-description" data-images="assets/images/clock840x400.jpeg">
							<p><i>May 21st, 2017</i></p>
							<p>For any new programmers who are starting off at their junior developer position or internship, I have some advice: <i>The 20 Minute Rule</i> (when to ask for help).<br><br>

							When I first started my web development internship at scientist.com, it was a bit overwhelming. Jumping into a massive codebase and making sure you don’t set anything on fire or bring down the company’s online platform had literally given me nightmares. Once I got over that hump, I ran into a new issue I hadn’t faced before.<br><br>

							I would spend a whole morning trying to fix a small bug, and would be hesitant to reach out for help. Was it pride? Was it because I wanted to get unstuck to learn from my mistakes? Or was it because I was hesitant to bother the software engineers on the team?  The answer for me was all of the above.<br><br>

							During my coding bootcamp at LEARN Academy, all of our daily coding challenges would consist of pair programming. Each day or week you would work with someone else in the cohort. I really value the concept of pair programming. Not only is it great for catching mistakes and being able to bounce off each other’s ideas, but it gives you the chance to learn from others and how someone else may break down a problem. Prior to the bootcamp, I had very little coding experience (basic html, css & javascript).<br><br>

							Some days I would be paired up with a classmate who had prior experience in programming. They would start breaking down the problem and have a solution while I was still scattering through my notes trying to figure out where to even start. Not only was it frustrating, but I felt like my programming skills would’ve improved a lot faster if I was able to break down a problem at my own pace. And of course I was worried about slowing down my partner and having them explain their solution repeatedly until my lightbulb came on.<br><br>

						 While some of the experienced pair programmers were patient enough and slowed the pace, others were not. Out of the 20 people in my class, there were about 3-4 others at my programming proficiency. I wanted to get most value out of the bootcamp, and it wasn’t until the middle of the program that I made it a priority to pair up with peers who could benefit from going at a slower pace.<br><br>

						 This is mainly why I thought it was okay to get stuck in a whirlwind of a problem at my internship. It was a way to make up for the days in my bootcamp that I wasn’t challenged enough and was given the solution without really understanding the process behind it. You should 100% try to figure something out on your own before asking for help, but don’t get stuck down the rabbit hole for half a day.<br><br>

						 The software engineer I reported to noticed my frustrations and I explained to him the reasons why I hadn’t asked him for help. He then told me about the “20 minute rule”, which means if you can’t solve a problem in 20 minutes, ask for help”. He would rather have me bother him instead of letting me spend all morning fixing a bug he may be able to easily fix within a minute or at least provide me with a hint on how to solve it. He stated a really valid point.<br><br>

						 I’ve come to learn that software development is all about efficiency and continuous delivery. You must be able to ship code to production on a daily basis. Being stuck on a problem for half the day is not only going to interfere with your workflow, but it will also negatively affect your team and the overall value you bring.<br><br>

						 If you’re stuck for more than 20 minutes and you are going to ask for help, I would highly suggest to jot down some notes beforehand to clearly state what the problem is and the solutions you’ve tried. Although you may be “bothering” someone for help, at the minimum you’re making it easier and quicker for them to help you.<br><br>

						 I’m so thankful to have been given this advice, and I hope I can forward this message onto any other entry-level developers in the same boat!<br><br>Would love to hear your thoughts and comments on this subject.

							<h2 class="project-title">"Software Craftsmanship"</h2><!--Project Title-->

						<div class="sr-only project-description" data-images="assets/images/audio-equipment840x400.jpeg">
							<p><i>June 6th, 2017</i></p>
							<p>In a recent interview I was asked to define what "software craftsmanship" means to me. I felt a sense of relief answering this question. Not only because it was a change of pace from a technical whiteboard question, but I had recently reflected on the similarities between software development and another passion of mine.</p>
							<p>From my understanding, having craftsmanship is the pursuit of furthering your knowledge and skills towards an activity or passion. Although someone’s end goal may be to perfect their craft, it’s the learning experience and realization of self-improvement that should be valued. This can directly relate to software development because there has to be a constant effort and desire to improve one’s skill, knowledge and efficiency to build greater software.</p>
							<p>I’ve come to understand the form of craftsmanship through one of my passions, which is djing. I started to learn the craft of djing about 3 years ago when I purchased my first set of turntables. I’ve always had a passion for collecting music and was always fascinated how one person can change the mood and energy of a crowd through music.</p>
							<p>I didn’t have the connections or funds for professional dj lessons, so it was up to me to spend time reading manuals, watching Youtube tutorials, and learning the fundamentals of music theory. I would record an hour of myself djing every night, then the next day I would listen back and critique my mixes. Consistent practice was key.</p>
							<p> And of course there were many frustrations with a self-taught craft: I was so wound up in the fact that it took me a lot longer to learn and gain the confidence to play in front crowds. I had lost a bit of passion because of this, and practice was starting to feel more like work over anything.</p>
							<p>The moment I started to truly enjoy the art of djing was when I took a step back and saw the journey it had taken me through. Although there were many frustrations, the sudden “aha moments” gave me the motivation and energy to keep moving forward. Similar to my music craft, learning software development has had it’s many frustrations, but it’s no doubtedly been rewarding and worthwhile.</p>
							<p> I’m 100% committed and motivated to seek more “aha moments”.</p>
